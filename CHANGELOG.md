## [1.0.0-nullsafety.0]
* Full support for null-safety
* Replacement of templateColumnSizes and templateRowSizes with columnSizes and
  rowSizes

## [0.11.0]
* Tons of bug fixes in track sizing
* Documentation overhaul
* Performance improvements (should now lay out far less frequently)
* Helpers and extension methods for row/column sizing
* New Scrabble example
* More tests

Sorry, but I had to break semver with this release. Check out
`1.0.0-nullsafety.0` for the null-safe version.

## [0.10.5]
* Remove the use of extension methods

## [0.10.4]
* Massive overhaul in layout algorithm, fixing a number of serious issues
* Debug painting support, where tracks and gaps are drawn differently
* Child overflow indicators
* Debug printing, behind a flag
* Cool new periodic table example

Technically, some of these changes are breaking from an API perspective, but
I think that it's unlikely that people run into them. I originally wanted to
publish under a new minor version, but `pub publish` is giving me issues because
of my nullsafe prerelease.

* Fix a lint

## [0.10.2]
* Add support for negative row/column gaps (thanks @daohoangson!)
